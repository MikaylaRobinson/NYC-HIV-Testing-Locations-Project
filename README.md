# NYC HIV Testing Locations Project
This is an analysis of the HIV Testing Location data from NYC Open Data. Using SQL, I am asking questions such as:
* How are the testing locations distributed throughout the boroughs?
* What type of documents does a certain location require to administer the test?
* Where are locations that allow walk-in visits for free testing?


## Data Overview
The HIV Testing Locations dataset gives information on:
* location (borough, zip code, address)
* contact information
* visit info (free or low cost testing, insurance)


## Data source
The data was downloaded as a CSV file and then converted to a MySQL database.
